Hi! Thanks for taking a look at my to-do list app. To get everything rolling you'll need to do a couple of things after you fork and clone:
1) You'll need to install the npm modules I used to make my app. To do this, type in `npm install`. 
2) You'll need to create a SQL database that stores my table information. To do this, go into the todo_list.sql file in my repository and copy and paste my sql commands into your own database application to create the todos and categories tables. 

That should be all you need to make your to-dos to-dones!
